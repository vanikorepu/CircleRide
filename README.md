# 🚗 CircleRide
**Uber, but only for people you know.**  
Trusted ride-sharing for friends, family, classmates, and communities.  

---

## 🌟 Concept
CircleRide is a hyperlocal ride-sharing app where users can request rides from *only their phone contacts* (or pre-approved groups).  
Safer than Uber, cheaper than Lyft, greener than solo driving.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js + TypeScript + TailwindCSS  
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Realtime)  
- **Payments:** Stripe (gas split)  
- **Maps & ETA:** Mapbox API / Google Maps  
- **Deployment:** Vercel
